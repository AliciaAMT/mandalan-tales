Current Node v18 LTS
NPM 10 LTS
Ionic 7

## Version Notes!
Install node using nvm to manage versions. Use Node 20LTS to install, but use 18 LTS for CLI usage. This is because Ionic Angular uses an earlier version, but Angular Fire and Firebase and other packages require a later version.

# Mandalan Tales

A text based, turn based mmorpg (massively multiplayer online role playing game) written with Ionic Angular(Typescript) and Firebase. This game is especially designed for accessibility and is playable with a screen reader on desktop and mobile. Originally written for a LAMP stack, it is being ported to Firebase for better performance and scalability.

See the [wiki](https://app.gitbook.com/o/vC7p6tuPYXKweabts9Fs/s/TofJ2VU8Z9C03NJP41ux/) for more information on the game itself and the story.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v16.17.0 or later LTS not latest!)
- use `npm ci` to install all dependencies NOT `npm install`
- use NVM to manage Node versions. NVM for windows can be found on Github [here](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows)
- use `nvm install 16.17.0` to install Node v16.17.0. Use `nvm use 16.17.0` to use Node v16.17.0. Use `nvm list` to see all installed versions of Node.
- use `ionic serve` to run the app in the browser
- use `ionic build` to build the app for production
- might need to reinstall ionic cli with `npm install -g @ionic/cli` if changed node versions
- might need to reinstall firebase cli with `npm install -g firebase-tools` if changed node versions
- might need to reinstall angular cli with `npm install -g @angular/cli` if changed node versions *** DO NOT DO THIS> IONIC WILL INSTALL THE RIGHT VERSION!!!

### Method

#### Command Line:

`ionic start`

Use tabs for future implementation. See https://ionicacademy.com/multiple-side-menus-ionic/ for adding menu to tabs. GitHub is https://github.com/AliciaAMT/academyMenus

See NOTES.md for more info.

`npm ci`

`npm install -g @angular/cli`

- Set up project in firebase. 
- Add web app in project settings. Angular Fire will copy your firebase config into your project. 
- Set up firestore.
- Set up storage.
- Set security rules for storage:
```typescript
rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    match /{allPaths=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```
*Note: This is not secure. It allows anyone to read and write to your storage. You should set up authentication and only allow authenticated users to read and write to storage.*
- Set up authentication. 
- Set up analytics. 
- Set up hosting.
- Set up functions.
- Set up firestore indexes.
- Set up firestore rules:
```typescript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```
*Note: This is not secure. It allows anyone to read and write to your firestore. You should set up authentication and only allow authenticated users to read and write to firestore.*


`ng add @angular/fire` (may need to use `firebase logout` and `firebase login` to get this to work)

`npm i ngx-quill@16.2.1-0`
`npm i --save-dev @types/quill@1.3.10`

`npm install ng-lazyload-image`

#### Install the image cropper package
`npm i ngx-image-cropper`
 
#### For mobile gestures
`npm i hammerjs`
 
#### Add native platforms
`ionic cap add ios`
`ionic cap add android`

#### For image upload with camera
`npm i @capacitor/camera`

#### For PWA
`npm i @ionic/pwa-elements`

```bash
npm install @capacitor/preferences
npx cap sync
```
*This is former Ionic Capacitor Storage. See https://capacitorjs.com/docs/apis/preferences*

NOTE! npx cap sync may need to be run after building the production app. Requires the 'www' directory with in idex.html file. Failed on first try.

### Structure
